THEN I find **semantic** HTML elements

*WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a **logical structure** independent of styling and positioning

*WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find **accessible alt attributes**

*WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in **sequential order**
